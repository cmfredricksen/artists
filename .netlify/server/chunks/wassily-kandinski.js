  return `<p>Wassily Kandinsky (// Russian: , tr. Vasilyevich , IPA: []; 16 December [O.S. 4 December] 1866 \u2013 13 December 1944) was a Russian painter and art theorist. Kandinsky is generally credited as one of the pioneers of abstraction in western art, possibly after Hilma .[1] Born in Moscow, he spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated at Odessa Art School. He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics. Successful in his profession\u2014he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat (today Tartu, Estonia)\u2014Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.</p>
<p>In 1896, Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts. He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I. Following the Russian Revolution, Kandinsky \u201Cbecame an insider in the cultural administration of Anatoly \u201D[2] and helped establish the Museum of the Culture of Painting.[3] However, by then \u201Chis spiritual outlook\u2026 was foreign to the argumentative materialism of Soviet society\u201D,[4] and opportunities beckoned in Germany, to which he returned in 1920. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art. He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944, three days prior to his 78th birthday.</p>`;
